# Power grid load every hour for 6 1/2 years

# units of grid load are megawatts.

# Feature engineering step 1:
# Merge the two data sets on their common field: Time
# Now we'll have access to the temperature data to predict power consumption
load_combined = merge(load_ercot, load_temperature, by = 'Time')


# Plot power consumption in the COAST region versus
# temperature at Houston Hobby Airport (weather station KHOU)
# We know this is going to be a useful feature, but it doesn't look linear!
# It looks more like a parabola
ggplot(load_combined) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=KHOU, y=COAST), alpha=0.1)

# Feature engineering step 2:
# Let's create a really useful feature: the square of temperature!
# This will help us estimate that quadratic-looking relationship
load_combined = mutate(load_combined,
                       KHOU_squared = KHOU^2)


# What about the Time variable?
head(load_combined$Time)

# first things first: let's get the Time variable into a format R understands.
# Right now R thinks it's just a string of characters.
# We need to tell R it's actually a time stamp in a specific format: Y-M-D H:M:S
# We'll do this with the ymd_hms function in the lubridate package

# Now let's plot power consumption in the COAST region over time
ggplot(load_combined) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=ymd_hms(Time), y=COAST))

# We notice strong seasonal trends (winter vs. summer),
# as well as a general upward trend as time marches on (pop growth).  
# We also expect power consumption to vary on a finer time scale:
#   - across the day (wake vs. sleep)
#   - across the week (weekend vs. weekday)

# Let's use the functions in lubridate to engineer some relevant
# features from the Time variable.
# remember: factor tells R to treat a number as a category and make dummies.
# This is important: we don't wanth month/day as a number, but as a label
# the last line will get us a feature that models an overall upward trend
load_combined = mutate(load_combined, 
                       hour = hour(Time) %>% factor(),     # hour of day
                       wday = wday(Time) %>% factor(),     # day of week (1 = Monday)
                       month = month(Time) %>% factor(),   # month of year (1 = Jan)

lm3 = lm(COAST ~ KHOU + KHOU_squared + month + weeks_elapsed + hour + wday,

lm4 = lm(COAST ~ KHOU + KHOU_squared + month + weeks_elapsed +

# a bit of an improvement

# 182 parameters

# lets go bigger!
# how about a model where the temp effects depend upon the day and the month?
# Note: poly(KHOU,2) is shorthand for "include a quadratic term in KHOU"
# using poly(KHOU,2) just makes it easier to type out all the interactions.
lm5 = lm(COAST ~ poly(KHOU,2) + month + weeks_elapsed +

# now 262 parameters
length(coef(lm6))

# and better still!!
# in fact a really big improvement
rmse(lm6, load_train)
rmse(lm6, load_test)

# what about an interaction between time of day and month?
# this accounts for differeing patterns of darkness at, say, 6 PM from one month to the next
lm7 = lm(COAST ~ poly(KHOU,2) + month + weeks_elapsed +
           hour + wday + hour:wday + 
           poly(KHOU,2):month + poly(KHOU,2):wday + poly(KHOU,2):hour +

# But... it's not clear whether this is actually better than the previous model.
# huge growth in number of parms for unclear difference in performance
rmse(lm7, load_train)
rmse(lm7, load_test)


# Let's try averaging the performance of our three best models over 10 train/test splits

}

# average performance across the splits:
# looks like the giant model is a little bit better...

# but it took 253 additional parameters to gain about 3% in performance over lm6
# sometimes ML is like that: massively more complexity might gain you only a little bit
length(coef(lm6))
length(coef(lm7))

# And remember, this is ML, not stats!
# Don't bother trying to interpret the model:
summary(lm7)

# with all the different dummy variables, quadratic terms,
# and interactions, it's nearly impossible to interpret the individual coefficients.
# But it's a pretty good "black box" predictive model! features in, predictions out
